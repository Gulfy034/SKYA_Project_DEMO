# SKYA_Project_DEMO releases & resources

EN/[CN](README_zh-CN.md)

~ this repo is totally for early gamedev ready-to-run performance tests in different platforms.

> [!WARN]
> **The characters & sites within this game are not connected to any person/organization/locates in reality, and the game's use of the engine, as well as any and all related in-game narratives and character nouns, in-game lines, and their derived cyber-stalks have no reality to point to, so don't bring it into the reality of experiencing this game!!!!**

~ the expanded gamename is called "SUNO-koncated-Yet-Another Project", and not a fan-game.

~ **Not ~~re-command~~ recommended for teens under 13-year-old of age OR people with photosensitive epilepsy!⚠️**

~ this is a game demo created by [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) v4.3.stable.mono.official 77dcf97d8. **(will use [Redot](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine) fork branch in the future updates & no longer fetch the godot master branch ever)**

> THIS GAME PROJECT IS STILL ON DEVELOPMENT!
